## Easy Trivia API
### Author: James Campbell
This is a simple api for interacting with a Mongo DB instance.

This is meant to support my Easy Trivia website.
The purpose being to allow users to save questions that they like, and be able to retrive those questions later.

This has been succesfully implemented with this and I am currently working on implementing the functionality client side.

In the future I plan to add some user validation.

As of right now the user name is a place holder, and anyone could enter a user name to see those related trivia questions.
